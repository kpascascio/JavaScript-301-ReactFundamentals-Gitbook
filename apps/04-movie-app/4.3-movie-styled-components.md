# Styling with Styled Components

### What Are Styled Components?

Styled components is an npm package that utilizes es6 & css in JS files to easily style React applications. Check out their awesome docs [here](https://www.styled-components.com/)! Styled components tend to be used inside of React files to keep styling together with the logic, in an organized and friendly way. This an awesome combined resource for all things styled components [here](https://github.com/styled-components/awesome-styled-components). Styled components are extremely powerful and popular, they are used by companies such as: Coinbase, Reddit, Target, Bloomberg, etc. 

To get used to styled components we're going to use them to style every part of our little movie application. For an extra challenge in the future you can feel free to restyle them as you wish.

The first thing we need to do to use them is to run `npm install --save styled-components`.

Let's first start with our `FormResults` file. Go ahead and add the following import to the top of the file, underneath your react import.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';
```

This is what we're going to go through making, then you can feel free to change anything into your own!
