# Movie Search App

Our next app we're going to build is a movie search app using [this](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API. 

### What We're Going to Build & Learn
- The first part of the app we'll build is an input that users can search for movies in, and display results based on what they type. We're going to learn how to incorporate APIs into react. 
- We're going to learn how to use `styled-components` inside each of our react files, to easily style things
- The second part of the app we'll build is a section showing new movies at the box office. Here we'll learn more about utilizing APIs in react.

### Getting Started

To start off our application, let's go ahead and make a folder for this application called `movie-search-app`, inside of our `apps` folder.

```
    └── src
        └── assets
        └── components
                └── apps
                    └── movie-search-app
       
```

Next, we need to configure out links/routes , so first inside of `Sidebar.js` insert the following link:

```js
<li><Link to="/movie">Movie Search App</Link></li>
```

In `_routes.js` add the following route.

```js
 {
      path: '/movie',
      exact: true,
      main: () => <MovieSearchApp />
    }, 
```

Now that we've set up our routing so that our app can find our new Movie App, let's go ahead and add our parent component file. Inside of `movie-search-app` create your first file called `MovieApp.js`. 

Let's go ahead and setup our parent component. Type the following code below into your `MovieApp`.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Form } from './Form';

export default class MovieApp extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="main">
                <div className="mainDiv">
                    <Form />
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Next, we'll start on our Form component!
