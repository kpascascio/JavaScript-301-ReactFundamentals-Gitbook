# Concepts Data

In this part we're going to create our object for our data. We're going to make an array of objects, similar to something that we might get as a response from an API. We're just going to just create our own data, and keep it in this file. In the future we will be using APIs, but for this app, we can just use our own data structure.

Create a file called `concepts.js` Note that the lower case is correct, as we are not creating a React component in this file. Type out the following code in this file. These are all concepts that you should be in the process of learning and understanding. The const `concepts` is what we'll be using for the core of this app, and the lifecycleMethods is for the challenge at the end! Go ahead and add everything to your file for now.

```js
export const concepts = [
    {
        text: 'Functional Components',
        done: false
    },
    {
        text: 'Fat Arrow',
        done: false
    },
    {
        text: 'JSX',
        done: false
    },
    {
        text: 'Class Component',
        done: false
    },
    {
        text: 'Props',
        done: false
    },
    {
        text: 'Constructors',
        done: false
    },
    {
        text: 'setState',
        done: false
    },
    {
        text: 'State',
        done: false
    },
    {
        text: 'Lifecycle Methods',
        done: false
    }
]

//For a Future Challenge
export const lifecycleMethods = [
    {
        text: 'componentWillMount',
        done: false
    },
    {
        text: 'componentWillUpdate',
        done: false
    }, 
     {
        text: 'componentWillUnmount',
        done: false
    },
    {
        text: 'componentWillReceiveProps',
        done: false
    },
     {
        text: 'render',
        done: false
    }

]
```

Next we're going to start forming the list of our concepts!
