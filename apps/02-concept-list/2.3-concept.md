# Finishing up ReactConceptsApp

Okay, now that we've got our two functional children classes, `ConceptList` and `Concept`, we can go ahead and work on the logic in our `ReactConceptsApp` component.

First thing we can do is add our new `ConceptList` component to our imports, all the imports together should now look like this:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import _ from 'lodash';
import ConceptList from './ConceptList';
import { concepts } from './concepts';
```
Additionally, now that we've set up our child components, we can now update our render to use these components! We need to use our `ConceptList` component, and set its props of concepts, and toggle. So we can pass along our state to concepts, and we need to create a method to pass to `toggle`. Let's go ahead and just call it `toggleConcept` and set up our `render()` to look like this.

```js
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="main">
                <div className="mainDiv">
                    <h1>Concept List App</h1>
                    <p>Use the list below to toggle concepts that you do or do not understand. Note that this will update when you refresh the page.</p>
                    <h2>General Concepts</h2>
                    <ConceptList concepts={this.state.concepts} toggle={this.toggleConcept.bind(this)} />
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
```

Now, we need to actually define what `toggleConcept` does! Basically, as we discussed before all we need this function to do, is to take the concepts, and compare them against the concept list, using the lodash find method. This compares a collection to a second thing (in this case `concepts`) and returns the first thing it finds truthy for. Then, we need it to set concept.done to the opposite of what it currently is, essentially toggling it. Then, the last part is we need to set state back to include the updated toggle on `done`. To see for yourself, what concepts looks like when it comes back, feel free to add a `console.log` at the first line of method. 

```js
    toggleConcept(concepts) {
        let concept = _.find(this.state.concepts, concepts);
        concept.done = !concept.done;
        this.setState({concepts: this.state.concepts});
    }
```
Hooray, now everything in our app should work!!! 

To see the complete code for ReactConceptsApp so far, check below to make sure yours matches up!

```js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import _ from 'lodash';
import ConceptList from './ConceptList';
import { concepts } from './concepts';

export default class ReactConceptsApp extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super(); 
        this.state = { concepts: concepts };
    }
    
    toggleConcept(concepts) {
        let concept = _.find(this.state.concepts, concepts);
        concept.done = !concept.done;
        this.setState({concepts: this.state.concepts});
    }
    
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="main">
                <div className="mainDiv">
                    <h1>Concept List App</h1>
                    <p>Use the list below to toggle concepts that you do or do not understand. Note that this will update when you refresh the page.</p>
                    <h2>General Concepts</h2>
                    <ConceptList concepts={this.state.concepts} toggle={this.toggleConcept.bind(this)} />
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Next, we're going to figure out how to add a new concept!
