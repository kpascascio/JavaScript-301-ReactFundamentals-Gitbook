# Friend List Component

We'll now add another component for creating a list. This is the component that we called in the lost module. Now, let's implement it.

### FriendList

Let's stub out everything we'll need here. We'll code with intent here, thinking about what we'll want to be able to do.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import FaTrashO from 'react-icons/lib/fa/trash-o'

const API_BASE = "https://rest.learncode.academy/api/jameshandshoe/friends";

class FriendList extends Component {

	constructor(props) {
		super(props)
		this.state = { friends: [] };
	}
	
	componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {

	}

	renderFriends() {

	}

	removeFriend(event, friend) {

	}

	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				Friend
			</div>
		);
	}
}

export default FriendList;

```

We know in advance that we'll want to render and remove friends, so we added those methods. Remember that ComponentWillReceiveProps is a lifecycle method that re-renders or “Reacts” to any new props 
passed to the component.  nextProps is a convention to help us increase readability of the 
code.   Once new props are received this.setState({}) will set the new data.


### renderFriends() method
We are going to need to map over our incoming data. So, we wrIf we map over any friends

Here's just some pseudo code to get think about what we need to do.
```js
renderFriends() {
		if (this.state.friends) {
			//Need to map over the incoming data
			//Need to add a friend's name and age to a list item
		} else {
			//Need to show that we haven't received any data.
			//Either there are no friends coming in from the request
			//Something went wrong on the network
		}
	}
```

That's the kind of thinking we need here. Let's get started with the if:.  

```js
renderFriends() {
		if (this.state.friends) {
			return this.state.friends.map(friend =>
				<div key={friend.id}>
					<li className="list-group-item">
						<strong>Name:</strong> {friend.name}
						<br />
						<strong>Age:</strong> {friend.age}
					</li>
				</div>
			);
		} else {

```

Now let's write the else.

```jsx

	} else {
		return (
				<div>
					<h1>Waiting for friends</h1>
					{this.state}
				</div>
			);
		}
	}
```

We'll call the method in the unordered list inside the component:
```js
					<h3>List of Friends</h3>
						<ul className="list-group friends">
				
				*********** Add call here ************
							{this.renderFriends()}
				*********** End call here ************
	
						</ul>
```

Now that we have implemented the code for the list, we can run the app. We should be able to see the friends list upon adding a friend to the form.


### Remove Friends

For another part of our CRUD, let's go ahead and write a remove method for friends.

```js
removeFriend(event, friend) {
		var id = friend.id;
		var tempFriends = this.state.friends;
		axios.delete(`${API_BASE}/${id}`)
			.then( response => {
				var deleteFriend = tempFriends.indexOf(friend);
				tempFriends.splice(deleteFriend, 1);
				this.setState({ friends: tempFriends });
			});
	}
```

If we go to the list and try to delete, we should be able to remove friends from the list.

### Calling the remove method

We can go inside the render function and call the remove method. We'll need to add a button with trash icon. We are going to want to have this method available for each item on the list. 

```js
if (this.state.friends) {
			return this.state.friends.map(friend =>
				<div key={friend.id}>
					<li className="list-group-item">

						<strong>Name:</strong> {friend.name}
						<br />
						<strong>Age:</strong> {friend.age}
						<button onClick={ () => { this.removeFriend(this,  friend ) } } >
							    <span><FaTrashO /></span>
						</button>
					</li>
				</div>
			);
```
We should now be able to run the app. Add a user, and then delete that user. This is just a start to using an api with React.

### The Final Code

Here is the `FriendList` code:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import FaTrashO from 'react-icons/lib/fa/trash-o'

const API_BASE = "https://rest.learncode.academy/api/jameshandshoe/friends";

class FriendList extends Component {

	constructor(props) {
		super(props)
		//console.log("FriendList Props", props);
		this.state = { friends: [] };
	}
	
	componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
		//console.log(nextProps);
		this.setState({ friends: nextProps.props})
		//console.log(this.state);
	}

	renderFriends() {
		if (this.state.friends) {
			return this.state.friends.map(friend =>
				<div key={friend.id}>
					<li className="list-group-item">

						<strong>Name:</strong> {friend.name}
						<br />
						<strong>Age:</strong> {friend.age}
						<button onClick={ () => { this.removeFriend(this,  friend ) } } 
							    className="btn btn-danger trash">
							    <span><FaTrashO /></span>
						</button>
					</li>
				</div>
			);
		} else {
			return (
				<div>
					<h1>Waiting for friends</h1>
					{this.state}
				</div>
			);
		}

	}

	removeFriend(event, friend) {
		var id = friend.id;
		var tempFriends = this.state.friends;
		axios.delete(`${API_BASE}/${id}`)
			.then( response => {
				var deleteFriend = tempFriends.indexOf(friend);
				tempFriends.splice(deleteFriend, 1);
				this.setState({ friends: tempFriends });
			});
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<div>
					<div className="col-xs-2">
					</div>
					<div className="col-xs-6">
						<h3>List of Friends</h3>
						<ul className="list-group friends">
							{this.renderFriends()}
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

export default FriendList;

```
