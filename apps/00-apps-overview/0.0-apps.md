# Part 8: Apps

The fun thing about React is how fun and easy it is to create really awesome apps using different APIs. In this section we will be learning how to utilize react efficiently to create a variety of different little applications. Each application will expand your React knowledge in some way, by incorporating different APIs, highlighting different strengths of React, and just practicing the basics. 

To get started, we first need to add some structure to our file system. Add a new folder called "apps" underneath components, this will be where we store all of the code and components for each of the apps we will build.

```
    └── src
        └── assets
        └── components
                └── apps
                └── concepts
                └── site
       
```
