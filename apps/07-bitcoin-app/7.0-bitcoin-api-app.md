# Bitcoin Api Challenge

Objective: *Your challenge is to build a component that shows data about Bitcoin over the last 30 days. You do not have to know about Bitcoin to do this. You are merely showing the data over time.*

### The Endpoint
Please use this [endpoint](https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/historical/close.json) to show the data over the last 30 days.

### Example Tutorial
If you'd like to see a great usage of the endpoint, there is a great tutorial that you can find [here](https://codeburst.io/how-i-built-an-interactive-30-day-bitcoin-price-graph-with-react-and-an-api-6fe551c2ab1d).

Do your best. You do not have to use a graph. It could simply be a list, or you could just do the tutorial above and fit it into this application.
