# Virtual Reality App

Surprisingly, you can write a Virtual Reality component with about 60 lines of code. 

For instance, the following [demo](http://ngokevin.github.io/aframe-react-boilerplate/) was built with this [component](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react-boilerplate/blob/master/src/index.js).


### Challenge:

Objective: *We'd like you to try your hand at building a small component using the `aframe-react` package. Notice that this package is already added into the `package.json` file.* 

### Helpful Tutorials & Sites
Feel free to build something from an existing tutorial or application. [Here's](https://www.viget.com/articles/creating-your-first-webvr-app/) a tutorial on how to build something similar.

React.rocks also has a number of applications that you could use to get started. 

Just so you know, it is possible to do more things than just video games or entertainment. For instance, have a look at this [application](http://www.360syria.com) about the situation in Syria. 

If you find this enjoyable, it might be something you can use or include in your capstone project.
